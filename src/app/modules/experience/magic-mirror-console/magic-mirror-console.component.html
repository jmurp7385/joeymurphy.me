        We were inspired to do this because we went through the process of setting up a smart mirror many times through
        the command line, so we wanted to create a more easily accessible user interface so more people can make their
        own Magic Mirrors.

        <mat-expansion-panel-header>What it does</mat-expansion-panel-header>
        Magic Mirror Console provides a user friendly interface to show and hide modules. It can also translate the
        modules to different languages.

        <mat-expansion-panel-header>How we built it</mat-expansion-panel-header>
        We built our own custom module for Magic Mirror and ran a web age on localhost which allowed us to send API
        calls to localhost and trigger events in the Magic Mirror environment.
